        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an undergraduate Information System and Technology student at Bandung Institute of Technology. I'm interested in the web development world, especially in the front-end area. I love to solve real-world problems by developing web applications. I have participated in several hackathons and business case competitions and my best achievement so far is becoming the first winner of BIOS hackathon 2021 in Multimedia Nusantara University. Together with my team, we developed a web application to solve the unemployment problem due to lay-off. I played a role as a front-end developer. Using React.js, I created our front-end web solution. I have got some official recognition for web development basic skills such as Basic Front-End Programming certification from dicoding and JavaScript basic certification from HackerRank. Aside from technical skills, I’m a highly adaptable person, I can get along with many kinds of people as I have done in many college projects. I’m pursuing a professional 
          challenge with a company that believes in individual development.</p>
